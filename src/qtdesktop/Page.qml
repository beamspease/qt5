    \brief A Page is an Item you can push on a PageStack

    A \a Page is the main Item pushed onto a \l PageStack. It normally contains a discrete
    set of information and interaction elements meant for the user to solve a specific task, and
    contains properties to use when working with a PageStack.
    See \l PageStack for more information.

         \li \c PageStatus.Activating: the page is transitioning into becoming an active page on the stack
         \li \c PageStatus.Active: the page is on top of the stack
